# Mapping_Earthquakes

The purpose of this repo is to provide a world map that shows the correlation of earthquakes to the location of tectonic plates on Earth. 


I have provided three options to view the world map: street view, satellite view, and night navigation view. On to top right of the page you will be able to choose one of the three options.

- Earthquakes with a magnitude of 0 to 5+ will be provided once you open the page, but if you click on the “Earthquakes” option on to top right corner of the page, it will disappear until you click it again. On the bottom right corner, you will also see a legend that will provide colors of the markers bases on the magnitude of the earthquake. If you click on a specific marker, it will provide you the magnitude and location of that specific earthquake.

- The Tectonic Plates are shown by the red line across the map. If you click on the “Tectonic Plates” option on the top right corner of the page, it will disappear until you click it again.

- Major Earthquakes with a magnitude of 4.5 to 6+ will be provided once you open the page, but if you click on the “Major Earthquakes” option on the top right corner of the page, it will disappear until you click it again. On the bottom left corner, you will also see a legend that will provide colors of the markers bases on the magnitude of the earthquake. If you click on a specific marker, it will provide you the magnitude and location of that specific major earthquake.


You will also have an option to view the map with either all three options, or just specific ones.
